### Setup

For NextUI to work correctly, you need to set up the CssBaseline at the root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx
import { CssBaseline } from '@nextui-org/react';
const Application = () => (
  <>
    <CssBaseline /> // ---> Normalize styles
    <AppComponent /> // ---> Your App Component
  </>
);
```

### Using NextUI components

Once NextUI is installed you can use any of the components as follows.
NextUI uses tree-shaking so the unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and
each component is exported separately.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@nextui-org/react';

const Component = () => <Button>Click me</Button>;
```

### Individual components import

```jsx
import Button from '@nextui-org/react/button';

const Component = () => <Button>Click me</Button>;
```
