# Getting started

Welcome to the NextUI documentation!

NextUI is a library of UI components created with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">React.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
styled-jsx</a> for building beautiful, modern and fast websites and applications, NextUI is
base on <a href="https://react.geist-ui.dev" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
GeistUI</a> and inspired by <a href="https://vuesax.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Vuesax</a>.

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install NextUI by running either of the following:

```bash
yarn add @nextui-org/react
# or
npm i @nextui-org/react
```

### Setup

For NextUI to work correctly, you need to set up the CssBaseline at the root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx
import { CssBaseline } from '@nextui-org/react';
const Application = () => (
  <>
    <CssBaseline /> // ---> Normalize styles
    <AppComponent /> // ---> Your App Component
  </>
);
```

### Using NextUI components

Once NextUI is installed you can use any of the components as follows:

```jsx
// import just the Button rather than the entire library.
import Button from '@next-ui/react/button';

// or less ideally
import { Button } from '@next-ui/react';

const Component = () => <Button>Click me</Button>;
```

You should import individual components like: `@next-ui/react/button` rather than the entire library.
Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which can significantly reduce the amount of code you
end up sending to the client.
