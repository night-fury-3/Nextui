# Getting started

Welcome to the NextUI documentation!

NextUI is a library of UI components created with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">React.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
styled-jsx</a> for building beautiful, modern and fast websites and applications, NextUI is
base on <a href="https://react.geist-ui.dev" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
GeistUI</a> and inspired by<a href="https://vuesax.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Vuesax</a>.

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install NextUI by running either of the following:

```bash
yarn add @nextui/react
# or
npm i @nextui/react
```

<Spacer y={2.5} />

### Setup

For NextUI to work correctly, you need to set up the CssBaseline at the root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx
import { CssBaseline } from '@nextui/react';
const Application = () => (
  <>
    <CssBaseline /> // ---> Normalize styles
    <AppComponent /> // ---> Your App Component
  </>
);
```

### Using NextUI components

Once NextUI is installed you can use any of the components as follows:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@next-ui/react';
const Component = () => <Button>Action</Button>;
```
