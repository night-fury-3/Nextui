# Getting started

Welcome to the NextUI documentation!

NextUI is a library of UI components created with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) for
building beautiful, modern and fast websites and applications, NextUI is base on [GeistUI](https://react.geist-ui.dev) and inspired by [Vuesax](https://vuesax.com/).

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install NextUI by running either of the following:

```bash
yarn add @nextui/react
# or
npm i @nextui/react
```

### Setup

```jsx
import { CssBaseline } from '@nextui/react';
const Application = () => (
  <>
    <CssBaseline /> // ---> Normalize styles
    <AppComponent /> // ---> Your App Component
  </>
);
```

### Using NextUI components

```jsx
import { Button } from '@next-ui/react';
const Component = () => <Button>Action</Button>;
```
