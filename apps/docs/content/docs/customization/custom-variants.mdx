# Custom Variants

NextUI allows you to create new variants for components that better suit your project's needs.
This can be done by extending the component and its properties, and customizing the styles.

All NextUI components has the `Styles source` link on top of the page. This link will take you to
the styles source code of the component. You can use this as a reference when creating your own
custom component.

> **Note**: For one-off customizations, refer to the [Override Styles](/docs/customization/override-styles) documentation.

## Creating new variants for non-slots components

Here's an example of creating a new component called `MyButton` that is based
on the [Button](/docs/components/button) component, but with extra colors and sizes. The 
[Button](/docs/components/button) component is a non-slots component, meaning that it does not
have any slots that can be customized.

For this example, we will be using the `Button` component's styles source code as a
reference. Go [here](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/blob/feat/v2/packages/core/theme/src/components/circular-progress.ts) to view the styles source code.

You can create or override the component `variants`, `defaultVariants` and `componentVariants`.

> **Note**: If you are not familiar with the variants concept, please refer to the [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/variants) documentation.

<Steps>

### Extend the original component variants

To create or override variants you need to use the `extendVariants` function. This function
allows you to create a new component based on the original component, and customize its variants.

```tsx
// MyButton.tsx
import { extendVariants, Button } from "@nextui-org/react";

export const MyButton = extendVariants(Button, {
  variants: {// <- modify/add variants
    color: { 
      olive: "text-[#000] bg-[#84cc16]",
      orange: "bg-[#ff8c00] text-[#fff]",
      violet: "bg-[#8b5cf6] text-[#fff]",
    },
    isDisabled: {
      true: "bg-[#eaeaea] text-[#000] opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed",
    },
    size: { 
      xs: "px-unit-2 min-w-unit-12 h-unit-6 text-tiny gap-unit-1 rounded-small",
      xl: "px-unit-8 min-w-unit-28 h-unit-14 text-large gap-unit-4 rounded-medium",
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: { // <- modify/add the default variants
    color: "olive",
    size: "xl",
  },
  componentVariants: [ // <- modify/add the component variants
    {
      isDisabled: true,
      color: "olive",
      class: "bg-[#84cc16]/80 opacity-100"
    }
  ],
});
```

### Use your custom component in your application

Then, you can now use your custom component in your application. Here, `MyButton` is 
used with the color set to `olive` and the size set to `xl`.


```tsx
// App.tsx
import {MyButton} from "./MyButton";

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <MyButton fullWidth color="olive" size="xl">
      Press Me
    </MyButton>  
  );
}
``` 

The new component will include the original props of the `Button` component, plus the new
variants that you have created.
