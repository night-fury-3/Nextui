After installing NextUI, you need do the following steps to complete the installation:


### 1. Setup Tailwind CSS

NextUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official
[installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add 
the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js

const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    './node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()]
}
```

### 2. Setup Provider

To ensure proper functioning of React Aria, NextUI utilizes the [React Aria SSRProvider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/SSRProvider.html) and [Overlay provider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlayTrigger.html#example) internally. 
Therefore, it is essential to incorporate the `NextUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `NextUIProvider` component
import { NextUIProvider } from '@nextui-org/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap NextUIProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <YourApplication />
    </NextUIProvider>
  )
}
```
