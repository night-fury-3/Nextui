# Introduction

Welcome to the NextUI documentation!


## What is NextUI?

NextUI is a UI library for React that helps you build beautiful and accessible user interfaces. Created on top of 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).

NextUI's primary goal is to streamline the development process, offering a beautiful and adaptable system design for an enhanced user experience.

## FAQ

### Is NextUI a Vercel related project?

No, NextUI is an independent community project and is not related to Vercel.

### How is NextUI different from TailwindCSS?

- **TailwindCSS**: Tailwind CSS: CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you style components, 
leaving you to handle lots of other things like accessibility, component composition, keyboard navigation, 
style overrides, etc.

- **NextUI**: NextUI is a UI library for React that combines the power of TailwindCSS with React Aria to provide
a complete solution for building accessible and customizable user interfaces. Since NextUI is built upon TailwindCSS,
 you can utilize all TailwindCSS classes within your NextUI components, ensuring optimal compiled CSS size.

### How NextUI deals with TailwindCSS classes conflicts?

We created a TailwindCSS utility library called [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) that automatically
handle TailwindCSS class conflicts. This ensures your custom classes will consistently override the default ones, eliminating any duplication.


### Does NextUI use runtime CSS?

No, NextUI version 2 employs TailwindCSS JIT, which generates CSS at build time, eliminating the need for 
runtime CSS. This means that NextUI is fully compatible with the latest React and Next.js versions.

### Does NextUI support TypeScript?

Yes, NextUI is written in TypeScript and has full support for it.

### Can I use NextUI with other front-end frameworks or libraries?

NextUI is specifically designed for React and is built on top of React Aria. As a result, it is primarily 
tailored for React applications. However, you can still use the CSS part of NextUI with other frameworks or 
libraries, but you will lose the benefits of React Aria and pre-built accessible components that come with NextUI.
