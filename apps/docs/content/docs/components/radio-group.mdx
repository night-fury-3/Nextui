# Radio

Radios allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options. All possible options are exposed up front for users to compare. Radio implementation is based on <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useRadioGroup.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@react-aria/radio</a>

```jsx
import {RadioGroup, Radio} from '@nextui-org/react';
```
