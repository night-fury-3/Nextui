  title="Static"
  desc="Static collections, as in this example, can be used when the full list of items is known ahead of time."
  files={dropdownContent.staticDropdown}
/>

> The Dropdown can be closed by clicking or interacting outside the popover, or by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key. When the popover is closed, focus is restored back to its trigger button.

<Playground
  title="Dynamic"
  desc="Dynamic collections, as shown below, can be used when the items come from an external data source such as an API call, or update over time. Providing the data in this way allows for Menu to automatically cache the rendering of each item, which dramatically improves performance."
