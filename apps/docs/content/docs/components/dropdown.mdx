## Import

NextUI exports 5 dropdown-related components:

- **Dropdown**: The main component, which is a wrapper for the other components. 
- **DropdownTrigger**: The component that triggers the dropdown menu to open.
- **DropdownMenu**: The component that contains the dropdown items. 
- **DropdownSection**: The component that contains a group of dropdown items.
- **DropdownItem**: The component that represents a dropdown item.

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: 'import {Dropdown, DropdownTrigger, DropdownMenu, DropdownSection, DropdownItem} from "@nextui-org/react";',
    individual: 'import {Dropdown, DropdownTrigger, DropdownMenu, DropdownSection, DropdownItem} from "@nextui-org/dropdown";',
  }}
/>

## Usage

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={dropdownContent.usage} />


### Dynamic items

Dropdown follows the [Collection Components API](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html), accepting both static and dynamic collections.

- **Static**: The usage example above shows the static implementation, which can be used when the full list of options is known ahead of time.
- **Dynamic**: The example below can be used when the options come from an external data source such as an API call, or update over time.
