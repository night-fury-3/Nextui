# Table

Tables are used to display tabular data using rows and columns. They allow users to quickly scan, sort, compare, and take action on large amounts of data.
The Table implementation is based on <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
@react-aria/table</a>

```jsx
import { Table } from '@nextui-org/react';
```

<Playground
  title="Static"
  desc="A simple example with static `rows` and `columns`, `cells` can also be statically defined as children."
  files={tableContent.staticTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Dynamic"
  desc="Table generated dynamically using a function based on the data passed to the `columns` or `items` prop respectively."
  files={tableContent.dynamicTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Custom cells"
  desc="You can render any React component in the `cells` prop. The `row` and `column` props are passed to the component."
  files={tableContent.customCellsTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Single selection"
  desc="You can set the `singleSelection` property as `single` to limit users to select only a single item at a time."
  highlightedLines="11"
  files={tableContent.singleSelectionTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Multiple selection"
  desc="You can set the `singleSelection` property as `multiple` to allow users to select multiple items at a time."
  highlightedLines="11"
  files={tableContent.multipleSelectionTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Colors"
  overflow="auto"
  desc="`Table` component allows you to change the color of the selected rows, checkbox, loading and sort icon by passing the `color` prop."
  highlightedLines="56"
  files={tableContent.colorsTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Bordered"
  highlightedLines="6-7"
  desc="You can change the full style to a bordered `Table` with the `bordered` property."
  files={tableContent.borderedTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Lined"
  desc="You can change the full style to a lined `Table` with the `lined` and `headerLined` properties."
  highlightedLines="6-8"
  files={tableContent.linedTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Sticked"
  desc="You can remove the padding of the `Table` with the `sticked` property."
  highlightedLines="6"
  files={tableContent.stickedTable}

<Playground
  title="Compact"
  desc="You can reduce the amount of vertical padding that each row contains by using the `compact` property."

<Playground
  title="Pagination"
  desc="You can paginate the `Table` data by using the `Table.Pagination` component."
  highlightedLines="63-69"
  files={tableContent.paginationTable}
/>

<Playground
  title="Infinty Pagination"
  desc="Table supports loading data asynchronously, and will display a progress loading set by the loadingState prop. 
  It also supports infinite scrolling to load more data on demand as the user scrolls, via the `onLoadMore` prop."
  highlightedLines="38-40"
  files={tableContent.infinityPaginationTable}
/>

> **Note:** This example performs client side async loading thanks to [@react-stately/async-list](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useAsyncList.html) hook, you can also create a custom implementation of it to fetch the data asynchronously.

<Playground
  title="Sortable"
  desc="Table supports sorting its data when a column header is pressed, to set a column as sortable, you can use the `allowsSorting` property to the `column` prop."
  highlightedLines="36"
  files={tableContent.sortableTable}
/>

> **Note**: This example performs client side sorting by passing **load** and **sort** functions to the [@react-stately/async-list](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useAsyncList.html) hook and by comparing the data using [@react-aria/i18n](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useCollator.html) **useCollector** hook. See the docs for more information on how to perform server side sorting.

<Playground
  title="Disabled keys"
  desc="You can disable specific rows by providing an array of keys to `Table` through the `disabledKeys` prop. This will prevent rows from being selectable as shown in the example below."
  highlightedLines="11"
  files={tableContent.disabledKeysTable}
/>

> **Note**: Its important to have a unique key for each row, otherwise the disabled keys will not work.

<Playground
  title="Disallow empty selection"
  desc="Table also supports a `disallowEmptySelection` prop which forces the user to have at least one row selected all the time. In this mode, if a single row is selected and the user presses it, it will not be deselected."
  highlightedLines="11"
  files={tableContent.disallowEmptySelectionTable}
/>

> **Note**: Its important to have a unique key for each row, otherwise the default selected keys will not work.

<Playground
  title="No animated"
  desc="You can disable the animation of the entire `Table` by using `animated={false}` property."
  highlightedLines="11"
  files={tableContent.noAnimatedTable}
