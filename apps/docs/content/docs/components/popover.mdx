# Popover

Popover is a **non-modal** dialog that floats around its disclosure. It's commonly used for displaying additional rich content on top of something. Popover implementation is based on [@react-aria/overlays](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlay.html).

```jsx
import { Popover } from '@nextui-org/react';
```
